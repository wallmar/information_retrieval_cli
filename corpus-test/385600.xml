<plot>The Pink Panther lives in a rundown house at the city dump. Hungrily he walks towads the city hoping to find something to eat. A magician drives past, and his hat falls onto the road. Out of the hat steps a giant rabbit, who cuddles the panther and happily starts following him. The rabbit rewards the panther with a luxurious dinner he pulls out of the hat. The panther tries to become rich by searching for oil, but only gets an oil can, and himself drenched in some oil that flows from the hat. When he cleans himself in a health spa, he stays too long in the steam bath and gets reduced to miniature size. Climbing into the hat makes him grow into an enormous panther, so he has to restore himself to normal size by visiting the spa a second time.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?385600</url></doc>
