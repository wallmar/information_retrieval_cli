<plot>Mystic Women of the Middle Ages Series II looks at the lives of six medieval women and how they use their spirituality - in the case of each of the women their mystic visions - to empower themselves in a world where patriarchy ruled. Filmed in Canada and in Europe, on location footage from Tuscany to Normandy, from Hungary and Belgium to Rome and the Rhine forms a rich colourful backdrop to the stories of each woman. Using visuals from archival manuscripts and famous frescoes, our stories will feature original music written for the series, voice-over readings from the surviving works of the women themselves, narration by Avril Benoit, and interviews with historians and other experts. The lives of Hildegard of Bingen, Margaret and Elizabeth of Hungary, Catherine of Siena, Bridget of Sweden and Joan of Arc are featured.</plot><url>http://localhost:8983/solr/movie.html?385611</url></doc>
